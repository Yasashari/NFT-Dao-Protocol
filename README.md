Guide
Clone the repo to your pc.
The smart contract has been used here deoployed on to mumbai testnet. 
You need to have atleast one TribeG nft to participate DAO event. You can mint TribG nft using this repo.  
To mint nft ,  you need to have mumbai testnet ether. 

Why this DAO:

You guys know some of the nfts are really worth high. Most of the people cannot buy those. This DAO is aiming to solved that issue. 
lets think this senario.  One nft is 5 ETH and its listed on this marketplace. (nft marketplace is another repo).
Few people gathered and buy that nft and relist 10ETH. lets think someone buy that nft. Once someoney pay 10Eth , then invested people will get their money 
back with the profit propotional to they invested to buy nft.
